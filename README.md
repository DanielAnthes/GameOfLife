# GameOfLife

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life [1].
This project served as a means to learn the basics of C++.

This project contains the game logic and a terminal interface in `gameoflife.cpp` as well as a number of example board configurations.
Configuration files must have the world's height and width as the two first lines, followed by an encoding of the initial state, where dead cells are indicated by 0's and alive cells by 1's.

The repository also contains a compiled binary for x86 Linux.
